This project right here is just a program to joke on others, rickrolling others with this program, there are 3 types of them


Ones, which are "coff_on_press" are ones with console hided from user, on any keypress, it opens your default browser(if it's not opened already) and opens new tab with url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ". Can be turned off with task manager(and other programs like that) and on button "Esc". # RickRolling-malware-

Just one of programs I made because of being bored -- the RickRolling Malware, if you can classify malware as program that works behind users normal reach, and maybe blocking user input. In the Malware folder there are those "malware" programs. 

Ones, which are "coff_on_press" are ones with console hidden from user. On any keypress, it opens your default browser(if it's not opened already) and opens new tab with url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ".

Ones, which are "con_on_press" are ones with console shown to user, saying "Come on, press any key ;-)". On any keypress, it opens your default browser(if it's not opened already) and opens new tab with url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ". Can be turned off with task manager(and other programs like that), on "X" button, and on button "Esc". 

Ones, which are "plain_rickroll" are just programs that will play "Never Gonna Give You Up" via beeping. Off it as you want
